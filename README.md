# Populate Dagbag

CI for populating an airflow dagbag

> **IMPORTANT: Master branch action removes all items in the dagbag and repopulates all of them. Please refer to the delta-only branch for a *smarter* way to handle this**

## Usage

```ylm
uses: colpal/actions-name
    with: 
    input_one: 
```
